Load ffig.el:
(require 'ffig)

This gives you an interactive command, M-x ffig. It works like M-x
find-file, but autocompletes to all the files in your current git
repository.

Prefix it with C-u if you want to find a file in a different git
repository.

Identical filenames are made unique by appending the deepest unique
portion of their path.
